      <h3>How long have you climbed for?</h3>
      <p>
        About 8-9 years. I started climbing whilst living in Newcastle. Thatâ€™s
        where my real love of outdoor climbing and training in dingy rooms
        started.
      </p>

      <h3>What is your favourite thing about climbing?</h3>
      <p>
        The freedom I feel when climbing is what keeps me coming back time and
        again. The happiness I get when simply moving on a wall. This coupled
        with the way you can constantly keep improving. I seem to always be able
        to find something I'm no good at and love trying to improve and seeing
        the progression.
      </p>
      <h3>What is your favourite thing about coaching?</h3>
      <p>
        It is so rewarding to see someone achieve a goal or objective because of
        something you said or did. You get to be part of someones journey and
        help along the way. I quite often work with people who have already
        climbed for a while but get stuck at a certain grade, to be able to
        watch and see things that they can then change can make a huge
        difference. When i get an email or see a client compete and suddenly
        they've made huge improvemnets, its so rewarding to know that you
        contributed to that success. Seeing that smile at the end is something
        you can't beat.
      </p>
      <h3>What is your favourite thing to coach?</h3>
      <p>
        My most enjoyable sessions are always teaching dynamic competition style
        movements. But my most successful and rewarding sessions are often the
        sessions that focus on the psychological aspects of climbing and
        competing. I know personally how frustrating it is to know your strong
        enough but have your head hold you back. So, being able to help someone
        overcome that is often great to see and usually an interesting puzzle to
        work out.
      </p>
      <h3>What is your best/proudest climbing experience?</h3>
      <p>
        I was always very proud of getting medals when i was younger, but now i
        am more proud of my ability to overcome the mental and physical struggle
        that comes with sending a project. I have managed to climb most of my
        top grades with some sort of injury. Excpet from my most recent tick,
        which was a mental struggle due to the sheer number of sessions on it,
        and falling at the end so many times, all of my projects have been made
        harder due to fear of injury. I climbed 'Caroline' 7C+ and 'God Save My
        Finger' 8A with sprained ankles, and climbed 'The Hatchling' 7C+/8A
        after spraining my ankle on it on a previous trip. All of these have
        been serious mental battles and also life time goals. The process to
        achieve them was never easy but the reward of pulling over the top will
        be moments i will never forget.
